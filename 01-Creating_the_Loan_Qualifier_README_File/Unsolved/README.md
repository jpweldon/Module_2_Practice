# Loan Qualifier Application

---

## Introduction:

This is a python command-line interface application that allows users to see qualifying loans from lenders quickly and easily. The application works by taking in a `daily_rate_sheet` csv file of loan criteria from various loan providers, asking the user a number of questions to evaluate their loan eligibility, and then it returns to the user a list of qualifying loans.

The premise of this project is the scenario that I am progressing in a role as an application developer at a fintech lending startup. The lending software that I have built has been a big success for the company. As part of that success, I have been meeting a lot with the BizOps team to discuss creating additional useful features.

At a recent meeting, a new must-have feature request emerged. Specifically, BizOps wants to know if my software can prompt the user to save the qualifying loans as a new CSV file.

### User Story:

"As a user, I need the ability to save the qualifying loans to a CSV file so that I can share the results as a spreadsheet."

### Acceptance Criteria:

"Given that I am using the loan qualifier command-line interface (CLI), when I run the qualifier, then the tool should prompt the user to save the results as a CSV file."

"Given that there are no qualifying loans, when prompting a user to save a file, then the program should notify the user and exit."

"Given that I have a list of qualifying loans, when I am prompted to save the results, then I should be able to opt out of saving the file."

"Given that I have a list of qualifying loans, when I choose to save the loans, the tool should prompt for a file path to save the file."

"Given that I am using the loan qualifier CLI, when I choose to save the loans, then the tool should save the results as a CSV file."
